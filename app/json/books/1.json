  "summary": "Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy. He lives with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and his cousin Dudley, who make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs. Then Harry starts receiving mysterious letters and his life is changed for ever. He is whisked away by a beetle-eyed giant of a man and enrolled in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The reason: Harry Potter is a wizard!"
